/// Decodes FaceMesh's raw outputs (1404 floats = 468 x,y,z; 1 face-presence
/// flag) and projects screen-space landmarks back through the rotated crop
/// rect into full-image normalized coordinates. Ported from mediapipe's
/// actual graph config (mediapipe/modules/face_landmark/
/// face_landmark_cpu.pbtxt, tensors_to_face_landmarks.pbtxt) — no local
/// third-party reference exists for this model (unlike
/// MediaPipeHandLandmarkProjection, which fasthands.pipeline already
/// validated), so this was derived directly from the calculator source and
/// sanity-checked with hand-computed cases, not validated end-to-end
/// against a real detected face.
///
/// Differs from the hand landmark model's decode in three confirmed ways:
/// `normalize_z` defaults to 1.0 here (TensorsToLandmarksCalculatorOptions'
/// own proto default — the hand model's config explicitly overrides it to
/// 0.4, FaceMesh's does not), presence needs an explicit sigmoid
/// (TensorsToFloatsCalculatorOptions.activation: SIGMOID in the graph,
/// applied outside the model itself — the hand port's third-party reference
/// reads hand presence raw, unsigmoided, which this deliberately does not
/// copy since there's no equivalent validated reference for face to check
/// that assumption against), and there is no handedness or world-landmark
/// equivalent at all for the base (non-attention) FaceMesh variant.
