/// BlazePalm's box/keypoint decode ported from and validated against
/// fasthands.pipeline.decode_detections/weighted_nms/iou (a validated
/// third-party port) to float32 precision on the real bundled
/// MediaPipeHandDetector model's output on a real image. BlazeFace's decode
/// confirmed by reading mediapipe/calculators/tensor/
/// tensors_to_detections_calculator.cc directly: `reverse_output_order`
/// selects `XYWH` box-channel order, matching what BlazePalm already
/// assumed (BlazePalm's own — older — calculator has no such flag and uses
/// the equivalent fixed order), so the same decode formula applies to both
/// unmodified. Pure Swift, no CoreML dependency — independently
/// unit-testable against synthetic tensors, matching RTMDetDecoderTests'
